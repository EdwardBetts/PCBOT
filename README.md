# PC-BOT-V2
WIP better-than-PCBOT discord bot using [discord.py].
This bot is the successor to PCBOT, my first discord bot. Seemed only fair to give him a second chance.

[discord.py]: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

## Version
PCBOT is supported

## Installing
The bot requires no extra python modules (as of yet). To install the bot, one can clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/PcBoy111/PCBOT.git
```

*Or*, just simply [download the repo as ZIP][zip].

[zip]: https://github.com/PcBoy111/PC-BOT-V2/archive/3.4.zip

## Running
Running the bot is simple. Go to the root directory of the bot, and run bot.py:

```
python bot.py
```

## Command-line arguments
Execute `python bot.py -h` to see a list of supported command-line arguments.
